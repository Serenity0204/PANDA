## 1. Introduction
The name of this architecture is **PANDA**, stands for *pretty average, not-well designed architecture*. The main goal of this ISA is to provide a smooth and user-friendly programming experience when coding in the PANDA assembly. To achieve this, we designed a special encoding and instructions to provide a large number of registers(16 General Purpose Registers). Additionally, we introduced macro instructions that expand into lower-level instructions, improving usability and readability. The PANDA machine follows a load-store architecture, so users who are familiar with ARMS and MIPS can easily transition to PANDA.

There are 3 cases: </br> 1. A > B, then GT register will be set to 1 </br> 2. A < B, then LT register will be set to 1</br> 3.

Similarly, the the destination register will be (assuming rd=1) `DEST_REG_IDX*4 + rd = 2*4 + 1 = 9`, so it will be using `R9` instead of `R1` for rd. Once the next instruction is done, both special purpose register will be reset to 0 `SRC_REG_IDX<=0, DEST_REG_IDX<=0`. The purpose of this instruction is to expand the number of register that the programmer can use, in the cost of a higher CPI.|



### Internal Operands
There are 16 general purpose registers, 7 special purpose registers.

| Register | Purpose | Note |
|----------|---------|---------
| R0-R15   | General purpose |N/A|
| CARRY    | Special purpose |For `ADC`, will be set in case of carry out in `ADD`, will be cleared after `ADC`|
| LT       | Special purpose |Will be set in `CMP`, will be cleared in the next instruction after `CMP`|
| GT       | Special purpose |Will be set in `CMP`, will be cleared in the next instruction after `CMP`| 
| EQ       | Special purpose |Will be set in `CMP`, will be cleared in the next instruction after `CMP`| 
| IM       | Special purpose |Can be set by using `LOAD_IMMEDIATE` instruction|
| SRC_REG_IDX| Special purpose |Will be set by the `SET_REG` instruction, will be cleared after the next instruction of `SET_REG` is done|
| DEST_REG_IDX| Special purpose |Will be set by the `SET_REG` instruction, will be cleared after the next instruction of `SET_REG` is done|



### Control Flow (Branches)
Both relative and absolute branching are supported. For both relative and absolute branching, it will be using the extracted 4 bits. </br>
1. Relative branching: user can branch to max of 8 instructions before the PC, or max of 7 instructions after the PC. So [-8, 7] is the range.
2. Absolute Branching: user can branch to an absolute address that's hardcoded and stored in the LUT, the 4 bits will be unsigned and will be the index of the LUT. The values inside the LUT can be address of any instruction in the program. So this will be the way to handle large jumps.

Below is the method of using branching in PANDA:
| Branch Type | Target Address Mode | Example Call | Notes |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------|-------|
| BEQ | RELATIVE/ABSOLUTE          | BEQ_ABSOLUTE/BEQ_RELATIVE | See concrete examples in the operation chart|
| BLT | RELATIVE/ABSOLUTE          | BLT_ABSOLUTE/BLT_RELATIVE | See concrete examples in the operation chart|
| BGT | RELATIVE/ABSOLUTE          | BGT_ABSOLUTE/BGT_RELATIVE | See concrete examples in the operation chart|


### Addressing Modes
Only indirect addressing is supported. If user wants to use immediate as operands for load/store or any other operations, they will have to be done by using the special `LOAD_IMMEDIATE` instruction. All of the immediates will be stored in a LUT, users can use indices to access the LUT and load the actual immediate into an `IM` special register, and use `IM` instead.

- Example
```PANDA
// assume R1 = 10
// assume IM = 300
LOAD R1, R0 // this will be R1 <- memory[R0] = memory[10]
LOAD R1, IM // this will be R1 <- memory[IM] = memory[300]
```

## Programmer’s Model [Lite]

1. Programmer's Strategy: The user should prioritize using as many general purpose registers provided as possible by utilizing the special `SET_REG` instruction. If all of the GPRs are used, the user can load/store stuff from/to memory, the memory operation can happen in between of other operations. If the user wants to use immediate, they must do it via the `LOAD_IMMEDIATE` instructions. For branching, the user can choose to branch relatively or absolutely, whichever they favor to choose.

4. Restrictions: Copying instructions from ARMS/MIPS generally won't work out of the box, due to the PANDA ISA needed `SET_REG` to use the other general purpose registers besides `R0-R3`. Other than that, the user should be careful using the store command in PANDA, since the operands order is differed from ARMS/MIPS(see the operation chart). Other than that, most of the common operations are supported in the PANDA ISA.



## 5. Program Implementation


### Program 1 Pseudocode
- Closest pair -- Write a program to find the smallest and largest Hamming distances among all pairs of values in an array of 16 bytes. Assume all values are 8-bit integers. The array of integers starts at location 0. Write the minimum distance in location 16 and the maximum distance in location 17. 

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

uint8_t max = 0;
uint8_t min = 0b11111111;

void hamming_distance()
{
    uint8_t num1 = 0b10101010;
    uint8_t num2 = 0b11111111;
    uint8_t num3 = 0b00000000;

    uint8_t arr[] = {num1, num2, num3};
    uint8_t size = 3;

    // find max
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < size; j++)
        {
            uint8_t a = arr[i];
            uint8_t b = arr[j];

            uint8_t x = a ^ b;
            uint8_t distance = 0;

            while (1)
            {
                if (x == 0) break;
                distance = distance + (x & 1);
                x >>= 1;
            }
            if (distance > max) max = distance;
        }
    }

    // find min
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < size; j++)
        {
            uint8_t a = arr[i];
            uint8_t b = arr[j];

            uint8_t x = a ^ b;
            uint8_t distance = 0;

            while (1)
            {
                if (x == 0) break;
                distance = distance + (x & 1);
                x >>= 1;
            }
            if (distance < min) min = distance;
        }
    }
}

int main()
{
    hamming_distance();
    printf("Hamming distance max is %u and Hamming distance min is %u", max, min);
    return 0;
}

```

### Program 2 Pseudocode
- 2-Term Product – For full credit, write a program that finds the product of two two’s complement numbers, ie, A * B. The operands are found in memory locations 0 (A), and 1 (B).  The result will be written into locations 2 (high bits) and 3 (low bits). Your ISA will not have a one-cycle “multiply” operation, so you will need some sort of shift-and-add algorithm. You may restrict your values to positive numbers (MSB = 0) only, with a 1/3-letter grade penalty for the course. 

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef signed char int8;

void robertson_mul_2_num(int8 A, int8 B, int8* upper, int8* lower)
{
    int8 P = 0;   // accumulator (upper 8 bits)
    int8 Q = B;   // multiplier
    int8 Qm1 = 0; // Q-1, starts at 0

    for (int8 i = 0; i < 8; i++)
    {
        int8 Q0 = Q & 1; // current LSB of Q

        // Step 1: add/subtract depending on (Q0, Qm1)
        if (Q0 == 1 && Qm1 == 0)
        {
            // P = P - A
            P = P - A;
        }
        else if (Q0 == 0 && Qm1 == 1)
        {
            // P = P + A
            P = P + A;
        }

        // Step 2: arithmetic right shift of (P, Q, Qm1)
        int8 newQm1 = Q & 1; // save old Q0 before shift

        // Shift right Q, bring in P's LSB
        Q = (Q >> 1) & 0x7F; // logical shift for now
        if (P & 1)
        {
            Q |= 0x80; // bring P LSB into Q MSB if it was 1
        }

        // Arithmetic shift right P
        int8 signP = P & 0x80;
        P >>= 1;
        if (signP) P |= 0x80; // keep sign bit

        // Update Qm1
        Qm1 = newQm1;
    }

    *upper = P;
    *lower = Q;
}

int main()
{
    int8 a = -15;
    int8 b = -12;
    int8 hi, lo;
    robertson_mul_2_num(a, b, &hi, &lo);

    // Combine hi:lo into 16-bit just for display
    int16_t result = ((int16_t)hi << 8) | ((int8_t)lo);
    printf("%d * %d = %d (hi=%d, lo=%d)\n", a, b, result, hi, lo);

    return 0;
}

``` 

### Program 3 Pseudocode
- 3-Term Product – For full credit, write a program that finds the product of three two’s complement numbers, ie, A * B * C. The operands are found in memory locations 0 (A), and 1 (B), and 2 (C).  The result will be written into locations 4 (highest bits), 5 (middle bits), and 6 (low bits). Your ISA will not have a one-cycle “multiply” operation, so you will need some sort of shift-and-add algorithm. You may restrict your values to positive numbers (MSB = 0) only, with a 1/3-letter grade penalty for the course.  

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

typedef signed char int8;

/*
 * Multiply signed A*B*C (each int8).
 * Result is 24-bit signed stored in (upper, mid, lower) all int8.
 *
 * Approach:
 * 1) m = A * B  using Booth 8x8 -> 16 bits (m_hi:m_lo)
 * 2) result = m * C using Booth with 16-bit multiplicand (m_hi:m_lo) and 8-bit multiplier C
